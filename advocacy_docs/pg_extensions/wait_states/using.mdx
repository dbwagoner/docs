title: Using EDB Wait States
navTitle: Using
---

When EDB Wait States is registered as one of the shared preload libraries, it probes each of the running sessions at regular intervals. For every session, it collects information such as:

-  The database to which it's connected.
-  The logged-in user of the session.
-  The query running in that session.
-  The wait events on which it's waiting.

This information is saved in a set of files in a user-configurable path and directory folder given by the `edb_wait_states.directory` parameter to add to the `postgresql.conf` file. The path must be a full, absolute path, not a relative path.

## Exploring data with the interface

Each of the functions in the EDB Wait States interface has common input and output parameters. Those parameters are:

| Parameter(s)                    | Input or output | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|---------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `start_ts` and `end_ts`         | Input           | Together these specify the time interval and the data to read. If you specify only `start_ts`, the data starting from `start_ts` is output. If you specify only `end_ts`, data up to `end_ts` is output. If you don't specify either, all the data is output. |
| `query_id`                      | Output          | Identifies a normalized query. It's internal hash code computed from the query.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `session_id`                    | Output          | Identifies a session.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `ref_start_ts` and `ref_end_ts` | Output          | Provides the timestamps of a file containing a particular data point. A data point might be a wait event sample record, a query record, or a session record.                                                                                                  |
| `wait_time`                     | Output          | Provides the amount of time in seconds spent waiting for some wait events. |
| `cpu_time`                      | Output          | Provides the amount of time in seconds spent working on the CPU. For this given duration the query wasn't waiting on any wait event. |
| `db_time`                       | Output          | Provides the sum of the `wait_time` and the `cpu_time`. The `db_time`, `wait_time`, and the `cpu_time` don't provide exact time but provides an approximate time computed based on number of occurrences and the sampling interval. |

The following examples use a scenario where three queries are executed simultaneously on four different sessions connected to different databases using different users. Those three queries are:

```sql
SELECT schemaname FROM pg_tables, pg_sleep(15) WHERE schemaname <>
'pg_catalog'; /* ran on 2 sessions */
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables, pg_sleep(10) WHERE schemaname <>
'pg_catalog';
SELECT tablename, schemaname FROM pg_tables, pg_sleep(10) WHERE schemaname
<> 'pg_catalog';
```

### `edb_wait_states_data`

Use this function to read the data collected by the BGW:

```sql
edb_wait_states_data(
  IN start_ts timestamptz default '-infinity'::timestamptz,
  IN end_ts timestamptz default 'infinity'::timestamptz,
  OUT session_id int4,
  OUT <dbname> text,
  OUT <username> text,
  OUT <query> text,
  OUT <query_start_time> timestamptz,
  OUT <sample_time> timestamptz,
  OUT <wait_event_type> text,
  OUT <wait_event> text
)
```

You can use this function to find out the following:

-  The queries running in the given duration (defined by `start_ts` and `end_ts`) in all the sessions, and the wait events, if any, they were waiting on. For example:

  ```sql
  SELECT query, session_id, wait_event_type, wait_event
    FROM edb_wait_states_data(start_ts, end_ts);
  ```

-  The progress of a session within a given duration, that is, the queries run in a session (`session_id = 100000`) and the wait events the queries waited on. For example:

  ```sql
  SELECT query, wait_event_type, wait_event
    FROM edb_wait_states_data(start_ts, end_ts)
    WHERE session_id = 100000;
  ```

-  The duration for which the samples are available. For example:

  ```sql
  SELECT min(sample_time), max(sample_time)
    FROM edb_wait_states_data();
  ```

#### Parameters

In addition to the common parameters described previously, each row of the output gives the following:

`dbname`

The session's database.

`username`

The session's logged-in user.

`query`

The query running in the session.

`query_start_time`

The time when the query started.

`sample_time`

The time when wait event data was collected.

`wait_event_type`

The type of wait event the session (backend) is waiting on.

`wait_event`

The wait event the session (backend) is waiting on.

#### Example

The following is a sample output from the `edb_wait_states_data()` function:

```sql
edb=# SELECT * FROM edb_wait_states_data();
__OUTPUT__
-[ RECORD 1 ]----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------
session_id       | 4398
dbname           | edb

                    .
                    .
                    .
```

### `edb_wait_states_queries`

This function gives information about the queries sampled by the BGW. For example:

```sql
edb_wait_states_queries(
  IN start_ts timestamptz default '-infinity'::timestamptz,
  IN end_ts timestamptz default 'infinity'::timestamptz,
  OUT query_id int8,
  OUT <query> text,
  OUT ref_start_ts timestamptz
  OUT ref_end_ts timestamptz
)
```

A new queries file is created periodically. Multiple query files can be generated corresponding to specific intervals.

This function returns all the queries in query files that overlap with the given time interval. A query gives all the queries in query files that contained queries sampled between `start_ts` and `end_ts`:

```sql
SELECT query FROM edb_wait_states_queries(start_ts, end_ts);
```

In other words, the function can output queries that didn't run in the given interval. To do that, use `edb_wait_states_data()`.

#### Parameters

In addition to the common parameters described previously, each row of the output gives the following:

`query`

Normalized query text.

#### Example

The following is a sample output from the `edb_wait_states_queries()` function:

```sql
edb=# SELECT * FROM edb_wait_states_queries();
__OUTPUT__
-[ RECORD 1 ]+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
query_id     | 4292540138852956818
query        | SELECT schemaname FROM pg_tables, pg_sleep($1) WHERE schemaname <> $2
ref_start_ts | 17-AUG-18 11:52:38.698793 -04:00
ref_end_ts   | 18-AUG-18 11:52:38.698793 -04:00
-[ RECORD 2 ]+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
query_id     | 3754591102365859187
query        | SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables, pg_sleep($1) WHERE schemaname <> $2
ref_start_ts | 17-AUG-18 11:52:38.698793 -04:00
ref_end_ts   | 18-AUG-18 11:52:38.698793 -04:00
-[ RECORD 3 ]+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
query_id     | 349089096300352897
query        | SELECT tablename, schemaname FROM pg_tables, pg_sleep($1) WHERE schemaname <> $2
ref_start_ts | 17-AUG-18 11:52:38.698793 -04:00
ref_end_ts   | 18-AUG-18 11:52:38.698793 -04:00
```

### `edb_wait_states_sessions`

This function gives information about the sessions sampled by the BGW:

```sql
edb_wait_states_sessions(
  IN start_ts timestamptz default '-infinity'::timestamptz,
  IN end_ts timestamptz default 'infinity'::timestamptz,
  OUT session_id int4,
  OUT <dbname> text,
  OUT <username> text,
  OUT ref_start_ts timestamptz,
  OUT ref_end_ts timestamptz,
  OUT application_name text,
  OUT client_hostname text,
  OUT session_start_ts timestamptz
)
```

You can use this function to identify the databases that were connected and the users that started those sessions. For example:

```sql
SELECT dbname, username, session_id
  FROM edb_wait_states_sessions();
```

Similar to `edb_wait_states_queries()`, this function outputs all the sessions logged in session files that contain sessions sampled in the given interval. It doesn't necessarily output only the sessions sampled in the given interval. To identify that, use `edb_wait_states_data()`.

#### Parameters

In addition to the common parameters described previously, each row of the output gives the following:

`dbname`

The database to which the session is connected.

`username`

Login user of the session.

`application_name`

Name of the application connection to the session.

`client_hostname`

Host name of the client machine.

`session_start_ts`

Actual timestamp when the session started.

#### Example

The following is a sample output from the `edb_wait_states_sessions()` function:

```sql
edb=# SELECT * FROM edb_wait_states_sessions();
__OUTPUT__
-[ RECORD 1 ]---+---------------------------------
session_id       | 184365
dbname           | postgres
username         | dilip
ref_start_ts     | 01-FEB-24 15:59:56.283204 +05:30
ref_end_ts       | 02-FEB-24 15:59:56.283204 +05:30
application_name | pgbench

application_name | pgbench
client_hostname  |
session_start_ts | 01-FEB-24 16:15:59.284207 +05:30
```

### `edb_wait_states_samples`

This function gives information about wait events sampled by the BGW:

```sql
edb_wait_states_samples(
  IN start_ts timestamptz default '-infinity'::timestamptz,
  IN end_ts timestamptz default 'infinity'::timestamptz,
  OUT query_id int8,
  OUT session_id int4,
  OUT <query_start_time> timestamptz,
  OUT <sample_time> timestamptz,
  OUT <wait_event_type> text,
  OUT <wait_event> text,
  OUT sampling_interval int4
)
```

Usually, you don't need to call this function directly.

#### Parameters

In addition to the common parameters described previously, each row of the output gives the following:

`query_start_time`

The time when the query started in this session.

`sample_time`

The time when wait event data was collected.

`wait_event_type`

The type of wait event on which the session is waiting.

`wait_event`

The wait event on which the session (backend) is waiting.

`sampling_interval`

The time interval at which the sample is taken.

#### Example

The following is a sample output from the `edb_wait_states_samples()` function:

```sql
edb=# SELECT * FROM edb_wait_states_samples();
__OUTPUT__
-[ RECORD 1 ]-----+---------------------------------
query_id          | -5489517304104177538

wait_event_type   | Timeout
wait_event        | PgSleep
sampling_interval | 1                    .
                    .
                    .
```

### `edb_wait_states_purge`

The function deletes all the sampled data files (queries, sessions, and wait-event samples) that were created after `start_ts` and aged (rotated) before `end_ts`:

```sql
edb_wait_states_purge(
  IN start_ts timestamptz default '-infinity'::timestamptz,
  IN end_ts timestamptz default 'infinity'::timestamptz
)
```

Usually you don't need to run this function. The backend usually purges those according to the retention age. However, if that doesn't happen for some reason, you can use this function.

To find out how long the samples were retained, use `edb_wait_states_data()`.

#### Example

This code shows the `$PGDATA/edb_wait_states` directory before running `edb_wait_states_purge()`:

```shell
[root@localhost data]# pwd
/var/lib/edb/as14/data
[root@localhost data]# ls -l edb_wait_states
total 12
-rw------- 1 enterprisedb ...  253 Aug 17 11:56 edb_ws_queries_587836358698793_587922758698793
-rw------- 1 enterprisedb ... 1600 Aug 17 11:56 edb_ws_samples_587836358698793_587839958698793
-rw------- 1 enterprisedb ...   94 Aug 17 11:56 edb_ws_sessions_587836358698793_587922758698793
```

This code shows the `$PGDATA/edb_wait_states` directory after running `edb_wait_states_purge()`:

```sql
edb=# SELECT * FROM edb_wait_states_purge();
__OUTPUT__
 edb_wait_states_purge
-----------------------

(1 row)
```
```shell
[root@localhost data]# pwd
/var/lib/edb/as14/data
[root@localhost data]# ls -l edb_wait_states
total 0
```

## Deactivating 

To disable EDB Wait States from collecting more data, enter: 

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET edb_wait_states.enable_collection TO OFF;
SELECT pg_reload_conf();
```

To reenable EDB Wait States, set `edb_wait_states.enable_collection` to `ON`. 

You can check whether the EDB Wait States is collecting data using a `SHOW` command. In the following example, data collection is enabled in EDB Wait States:

```sql 
edb=#SHOW edb_wait_states.enable_collection;
__OUTPUT__
 edb_wait_states.enable_collection 
-----------------------------------
 on
(1 row) 
```
