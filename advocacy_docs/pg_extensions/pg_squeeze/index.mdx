PG Squeeze (pg_squeeze) is an extension released as open source software under the PostgreSQL License. 

PG Squeeze removes unused space from a table and optionally sorts tuples according to particular index (as if CLUSTER command was executed concurrently with regular reads / writes). In fact, we try to replace pg_repack extension.

While providing very similar functionality, pg_squeeze takes a different approach by:

- Implementing functionality purely on server side. This approach makes both configuration and use simpler (compared to `pg_repack`, which uses both server- and client-side code). Server-side implementation also allows for smooth implementation of unattended processing using background workers.

- Utilizing recent improvements of the PostgreSQL database server. Most notably, besides the use of background workers, `pg_squeeze` uses logical decode instead of triggers to capture concurrent changes.
