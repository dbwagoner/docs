Ensure that PostgreSQL is installed  and `pg_config` is present, as described in [Configuring](configuring).

Perform the following commands:

```shell
make # Compile the newer version.
pg_ctl -D /path/to/cluster stop # Stop the cluster.
make install
pg_ctl -D /path/to/cluster start # Start the cluster.
```

Connect to each database containing `pg_squeeze` and run this command:

```shell
ALTER EXTENSION pg_squeeze UPDATE;
```

## Upgrading from 1.2.x

Because there is no straightforward way to migrate scheduling information automatically (see the notes on the schedule column of the `squeeze.tables` table), and because the schedule column must not contain `NULL` values, the upgrade deletes the contents of the `squeeze.tables` table. Export the table contents to a file before you perform the upgrade and configure the checks of those tables again as soon as the upgrade is complete.
