|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enhancement  | Added `EmailGroup` and `EmailGroupID` in webhook payload.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Enhancement  | Added an alert template to validate password expiry for users in EDB Postgres Advanced Server. Also modified the alert template `A user expired in N days` to `Number of users expiring in N days` that checks the number of users expiring.[^*] |
| Enhancement  | Added a button on the Manage Probes window that resets the probe configurations to the defaults.                                                                                                                                                         |
| Enhancement  | Added a **Cleared Alert** button in notifications. This gives you the flexibility to disable notifications for cleared alerts while still receiving notifications when alerts occur.                                                                |
| Enhancement  | You can now create your own web server certificates, as EDB details are no longer added to the web server certificates generated by PEM.                                                                                                             |
| Enhancement  | Added a capability to identify the user who changed the blackout status, date, and time.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue where the deleted custom probe was still visible in the **Probe Dependency** tab of Alert Templates.                                                                                                                                         |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed the missing permission issue by granting the pem_agent user permission to `custom_email_template` table.                                                                                                                                      |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Excluded 0 sized tables from PEM alert template `largest index by table-size percentage`. Also added the detailed SQL statement for this template.                                                                                                  |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | You can now use `v11` as the REST endpoint from the cli.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Log in user must have appropriate roles to access `Failover Manager Utilities` and `Database server service management`.                                                                                                                            |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Added `application_name` column in the `session_info` probe.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed the `too few arguments` exception for the webhooks.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Resolved the issue where the `User` column displayed the current username logged into the PEM GUI in the chart display of pg_hba.conf file. Now it displays the respective usernames in the pg_hba.conf file.                                       |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an `Dashboard info not found` error while opening the dashboards in GUI.                                                                                                                                                                      |
