| Enhancement  | Added `EmailGroup` and `EmailGroupID` in webhook payload.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Enhancement  | Added a new alert template to validate the password expiry for the users specific to EDB Postgres Advanced Server. Also modified the alert template `A user expired in N days` to `Number of users expiring in N days` that checks the number of users getting exprired. |
| Enhancement  | Added a button on the Manage Probes window that resets the probe configurations to default.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Enhancement  | Added a `Cleared Alert` button in notifications, to mute the cleared alerts. This enhancement provides the flexibility to avoid getting notifications for the cleared alerts.                                                                                            |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue where the deleted custom probe was still visible in probe dependency tab of Alert Templates.                                                                                                                                                              |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed the missing permission issue by granting the pem_agent user permission to `custom_email_template` table.                                                                                                                                                           |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Excluded 0 sized tables from PEM alert template `largest index by table-size percentage`. Also added the detail info sql for this template.                                                                                                                              |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Use `v11` as the REST endpoint from the cli.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Logged-in user must have appropriate roles to access `Failover Manager Utilities` and `Database server service management`.                                                                                                                                              |
