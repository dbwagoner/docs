EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) provides multi-master replication and data distribution with advanced conflict management, data-loss protection, and [throughput up to 5X faster than native logical replication](https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/performance-improvements-edb-postgres-distributed). It enables distributed Postgres clusters with high availability up to five 9s.

By default, EDB Postgres Distributed uses asynchronous replication, applying changes on
the peer nodes only after the local commit. You can configure additional levels of synchronicity between different nodes, groups of nodes, or all nodes by configuring
[Group Commit](durability/group-commit), [CAMO](durability/camo), or
[Eager](consistency/eager) Replication.
