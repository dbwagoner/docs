## Creating the PGD cluster

### Preparation

For each node we want to create a connection string which will allow PGD to preform replication.

The connection string is a key/value string which starts with a `host=` and the IP address of the host (or if you have resolvable named hosts, the name of the host).

That is followed by the name of the database; `dbname=bdrbd` as we created a `bdrdb` database when [installing the software](04-installing-software).

We recommend you also add the port number of the server to your connection string as `port=5444` for EDB Postgres Advanced Server and `port=5432` for EDB Postgres Extended and Community PostgreSQL.

### Creation

To create the cluster, we select and log into one of the hosts Postgres server's `bdrdb` database. 

Run `bdr.create_node` and give the node a name and its connection string where *other* nodes may connect to it.

Create a top-level group for the cluster with `bdr.create_node_group` giving it a single parameter, the name of the top-level group.

Create a sub-group as a child of the top-level group with `bdr.create_node_group` giving it two parameters, the name of the sub-group and the name of the parent (and top-level) group.

This initialises the first node.

Now log into another initialised node's `bdrdb` database.

Run `bdr.create_node` and give the node a different name and its connection string where *other* nodes may connect to it.

Next, run `bdr.join_node_group` passing two parameters, the connection string for the first node and the name of the sub-group you want the node to join.

Repeat these steps to initialise the third node.


## Worked example

So far, we have:

* Created three Hosts.
* Installed a Postgres server on each host.
* Installed Postgres Distributed on each host.
* Configured the Postgres server to work with PGD on each host.

To create the cluster, we will tell `host-one`'s Postgres instance that it is a PGD node - `node-one` and create PGD groups on that node.
Then we will tell `host-two` and `host-three`'s Postgres instances that they are PGD nodes - `node-two` and `node-three` and that they should join a group on `node-one`.

### Create connection strings for each node

We calculate the connection strings for each of the node in advance. 
Below are the connection strings for our 3 node example:

| Name       | Node Name  | Private IP      | Connection string                      |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| host-one   | node-one   | 192.168.254.166 | host=host-one dbname=bdrdb port=5444   |
| host-two   | node-two   | 192.168.254.247 | host=host-two dbname=bdrdb port=5444   |
| host-three | node-three | 192.167.254.135 | host=host-three dbname=bdrdb port=5444 |

### Preparing the first node 

Log into host-one's Postgres server.

```
ssh admin@host-one
sudo -iu enterprisedb psql bdrdb
```

### Create the first node

Call the [`bdr.create_node`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrcreate_node) function to create a node, passing it the node name and a connection string which other nodes can use to connect to it.

```
select bdr.create_node('node-one','host=host-one dbname=bdrdb port=5444');
```

#### Create the top-level group

Call the [`bdr.create_node_group`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrcreate_node_group) function to create a top-level group for your PGD cluster. Passing a single string parameter will create the top-level group with that name. For our example, we will create a top-level group named `pgd`.

```
select bdr.create_node_group('pgd');
```

#### Create a sub-group

Call the [`bdr.create_node_group`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrcreate_node_group) function again to create a sub-group of the top-level group. The sub-group name is the first parameter, the parent group is the second parameter. Using sub-groups to organise your nodes is recommended. For our example, we will create a sub-group `dc1` as a child of `pgd`.

```
select bdr.create_node_group('dc1','pgd');
```

### Adding the second node

Log into host-two's Postgres server

```
ssh admin@host-two
sudo -iu enterprisedb psql bdrdb
```

#### Create the second node

We call the [`bdr.create_node`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrcreate_node) function to create this node, passing it the node name and a connection string which other nodes can use to connect to it.

```
select bdr.create_node('node-two','host=host-two dbname=bdrdb port=5444');
```

#### Join the node group

Using [`bdr.join_node_group`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrjoin_node_group) we can ask node-two to join node-one's `dc1` group. The function takes as a first parameter the connection string of a node already in the group, and the group name as a second parameter.

```
select bdr.join_node_group('host=host-one dbname=bdrdb port=5444','dc1');
```

### Adding the third node

Log into host-three's Postgres server

```
ssh admin@host-three
sudo -iu enterprisedb psql bdrdb
```

#### Create the third node

We call the [`bdr.create_node`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrcreate_node) function to create this node, passing it the node name and a connection string which other nodes can use to connect to it.

```
select bdr.create_node('node-three','host=host-three dbname=bdrdb port=5444');
```

#### Join the node group

Using [`bdr.join_node_group`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrjoin_node_group) we can ask node-three to join node-one's `dc1` group. The function takes as a first parameter the connection string of a node already in the group, and the group name as a second parameter.

```
select bdr.join_node_group('host=host-one dbname=bdrdb port=5444','dc1');
```

We have now created a PGD cluster.
