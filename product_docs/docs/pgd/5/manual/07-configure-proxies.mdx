## Configure proxies

### Configure the cluster for proxies

To set up a proxy, you will need to first prepare the cluster and sub-group the proxies will be working with by:

* Logging in and setting the `enable_raft` and `enable_proxy_routing` node group options to `true` for the sub-group. Use [`bdr.alter_node_group_option`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdralter_node_group_option), passing the sub-group name, option name and new value as parameters.
* Create as many uniquely named proxies as you plan to deploy using [`bdr.create_proxy`](/pgd/latest/reference/routing#bdrcreate_proxy) and passing the new proxy name and the sub-group it should be attached to.
* Create a pgdproxy user on the cluster with a password (or other authentication)

### Configure each host as a proxy

Once the cluster is ready, you will need to configure each host to run pgd-proxy by:

* Creating a pgdproxy local user
* Creating a `.pgpass` file for that user which will allow it to log into the cluster as `pgdproxy`.
* Modify the systemd service file for pgdproxy to use the pgdproxy user.
* Create a proxy config file for the host which lists the connection strings for all the nodes in the sub-group, specifies the name that the proxy should use when connected and gives the endpoint connection string the proxy will accept connections on.
* Install that file as `/etc/edb/pgd-proxy/pgd-proxy-config.yml`
* Restart the systemd service and check its status.

Further detail on all these steps is included in the Working example.

## Working example

## Preparing for proxies

For proxies to function, the `dc1` subgroup must enable Raft and routing.

Log into any node in the cluster.

```
SELECT bdr.alter_node_group_option('dc1', 'enable_raft', 'true');
SELECT bdr.alter_node_group_option('dc1', 'enable_proxy_routing', 'true');
```

Next, create a PGD proxy within the cluster using the `bdr.create_proxy` function.
This function takes two parameters, the proxies unique name and the group it should be a proxy for.

In our example, we want a proxy on each host in the dc1 sub-group:

```
SELECT bdr.create_proxy('pgd-proxy-one','dc1');
SELECT bdr.create_proxy('pgd-proxy-two','dc1');
SELECT bdr.create_proxy('pgd-proxy-three','dc1');
```

## Create a pgdproxy user on the database

Create a password for the pgdproxy user. In this example we will use `proxysecret`

On any node, log into the database as enterprisedb/postgres

```
CREATE USER pgdproxy PASSWORD 'proxysecret';
GRANT bdr_superuser TO pgdproxy;
```

## Create a pgdproxy user on each host

```
sudo adduser pgdproxy
```

This user will need credentials to connect to the server.
We will create a .pgpass file with the `proxysecret` password in it.
Then we will lock down the `.pgpass` file so it is only accessible by its owner.

```
echo -e "*:*:*:pgdproxy:proxysecret" | sudo tee /home/pgdproxy/.pgpass
sudo chown pgdproxy /home/pgdproxy/.pgpass
sudo chmod 0600 /home/pgdproxy/.pgpass
```

## Configure the systemd service on each host

Switch the service file from using root to using the pgdproxy user

```
sudo sed -i s/root/pgdproxy/ /usr/lib/systemd/system/pgd-proxy.service
```

Reload the systemd daemon.

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

## Create a proxy config file for each host

The proxy configuration file will be slightly different for each host.
It is a YAML file which contains a cluster object. This in turn has three
properties:

The name of the PGD cluster's top-level group (as `name`).
An array of endpoints of databases (as `endpoints`).
The proxy definition object with a name and endpoint (as `proxy`).

The first two properties will be the same for all hosts:

```
cluster:
  name: pgd
  endpoints:
    - host=host-one dbname=bdrdb port=5444
    - host=host-two dbname=bdrdb port=5444
    - host=host-three dbname=bdrdb port=5444
```

Note that the endpoints in this example specify port=5444.
This is necessary for EDB Postgres Advanced Server instances.
For EDB Postgres Extended and Community PostgreSQL, this can be omitted.

The third property, `proxy`, has a `name` property and an `endpoint` property.
The `name` property should be a name created with `bdr.create_proxy` earlier, and it will be different on each host.
The `endpoint` property is a string which defines how the proxy presents itself as a connection string.
Conventionally, proxies should be on a different port from direct connections and typically for PGD proxies we use port 6432.

```
  proxy:
    name: pgd-proxy-one
    endpoint: "host=localhost dbname=bdrdb port=6432"
```

## Install a PGD proxy configuration on each host

For each host, create the `/etc/edb/pgd-proxy` directory:

```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/edb/pgd-proxy
```

Then on each host, write the appropriate configuration to the `pgd-proxy-config.yml` file in the `/etc/edb/pgd-proxy` directory.

For our example, this could be run on host-one to create the file.

```
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/edb/pgd-proxy/pgd-proxy-config.yml
cluster:
  name: pgd
  endpoints:
    - host=host-one dbname=bdrdb port=5444
    - host=host-two dbname=bdrdb port=5444
    - host=host-three dbname=bdrdb port=5444
  proxy:
    name: pgd-proxy-one
    endpoint: "host=localhost dbname=bdrdb port=6432"
EOF
```

## Restart the service

```
sudo systemctl restart pgd-proxy
```

Confirm it is running correctly with:

```
sudo systemctl status pgd-proxy
```

It should show `Active: (running)` in the opening details.
