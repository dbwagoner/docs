## Provisioning hosts

The first step in the process of deploying PGD is to provision and configure hosts.

You can deploy to virtual machine instances in the cloud with Linux installed, on-premise virtual machines with Linux installed or on-premise physical hardware also with Linux installed. 

Whichever [supported Linux operating system](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility#bdr) and whichever deployment platform you select, the result of provisioning a machine should be a Linux system that can be accessed by you using SSH.

Each machine provisioned should be able to make connections to any other machine you are provisioning for your cluster. 
On cloud deployments, this may be done over the public network or over a VPC. 
On-premise deployments should be able to connect over the local network.

!!! Note Cloud provisioning guides

If you are new to cloud provisioning, these guides may provide assistance:

  Microsoft | Azure | [Quickstart: Create a Linux virtual machine in the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-portal?tabs=ubuntu)

## Configuring hosts

### Create an admin user

We recommend that you configure an admin user for each provisioned instance. 
The admin user should be configured for SSH access using certificates. 
The admin user should have sudo privileges.
