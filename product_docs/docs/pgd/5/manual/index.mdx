The best installation process is automatic, which is why PGD is available and deployable using TPA (Trusted Postgres Architect). 
Consult [Deploying with TPA](../tpa/) for how to install TPA and use it's automated best-practice driven PGD deployment options for full details.
Or refer to any of the [Quickstart walkthroughs](../quickstart/) which use TPA to get you up and running quickly.

This section of the documentation looks at the basic operations needed to configure a three-node PGD cluster, with sub-groups, PGD Proxy and PGD CLI.
This includes, for completeness, how to install PostgreSQL.
If you are familiar with that, then skip to step 3.
Each step will be outlined and followed by a worked example with further detail. 
This is not a quickstart guide, but an exploration of PGD installation, and it will configure a basic deployment which we will be using for further examples of PGD administration tasks.



At the highest level, manually deploying PGD involves the following steps:

1: [Provisioning and configuring hosts](01-provisioning-hosts) to run the cluster on.

2: [Installing your selected Postgres version](02-install-postgres) on each of the hosts.

3: [Configuring repositories to install PGD](03-configuring-repositories) to add PGD capabilities to each host.

4: [Initialising Postgres and installing PGD software](04-installing-software) on each host.

5: [Connecting the cluster](05-creating-cluster) by connecting to each node and telling it to join the cluster.

6: [Check the cluster](06-check-cluster) by running SQL commands and confirming replication has happened.

7: [Configuring proxies](07-configure-proxies) by creating a proxy config file.

8: [Using PGD CLI](08-using-pgd-cli) 

In the examples, we will be deploying a 3-node cluster of EDB Postgres Advanced Server 16 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9. These instructions should also apply to RHEL derivatives like Alma Linux, Rocky Linux, or Oracle Linux.
