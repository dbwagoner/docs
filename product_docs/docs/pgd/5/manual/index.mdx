At the highest level, manually deploying PGD involves the following steps:

1: [Provisioning and configuring hosts](01-provisioning-hosts) to run the cluster on.

2: [Installing your selected Postgres version](02-install-postgres) on each of the hosts.

3: [Configuring repositories to install PGD](03-configuring-repositories) to add PGD capabilities to each host.

4: [Initialising Postgres and installing PGD software](04-installing-software) on each host.

5: [Connecting the cluster](05-creating-cluster) by connecting to each node and telling it to join the cluster.

In the examples, we will be deploying a 3 node cluster of EDB Postgres Advanced Server 16 on Rocky Linux (A RHEL derivative).
