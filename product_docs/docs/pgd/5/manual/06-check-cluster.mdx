## Checking the cluster

With the cluster up and running, it is worth running some basic checks on how effectively it is replicating.

The simplest way to test the cluster is replicating is to log into one node, create a table and populate it.
Then log into another node and confirm that the table schema and content is replicated on that node.

In the following worked example, we show one quick way to do this but you should ensure that any testing you perform is appropriate for your use case.

## Worked example

### Preparation

Log into host-one's Postgres server.
```
ssh admin@host-one
sudo -iu enterprisedb psql bdrdbdoc
```

This is your connection to PGD's node-one.

To ensure that the cluster is ready to go, run: 

```
select bdr.wait_slot_confirm_lsn(NULL, NULL)
```

In another window, log into host-two's Postgres server

```
ssh admin@host-two
sudo -iu enterprisedb psql bdrdb
```

### Create data

#### On node-one

Run

```sql
CREATE TABLE quicktest ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, value INT ); 
INSERT INTO quicktest (value) SELECT random()*10000 FROM generate_series(1,10000);
```

This will generate a table of 10000 rows of random values. As soon as possible, run:

```sql
select * from bdr.node_replication_rates;
```

And you should see statistics on how quickly that data has been replicated to the other two nodes.

```console
bdrdb=# select * from bdr.node_replication_rates;
 peer_node_id | target_name | sent_lsn  | replay_lsn | replay_lag | replay_lag_bytes | replay_lag_size | apply_rate | catchup_interv

--------------+-------------+-----------+------------+------------+------------------+-----------------+------------+---------------

   1954860017 | node-three  | 0/DDAA908 | 0/DDAA908  | 00:00:00   |                0 | 0 bytes         |      13682 | 00:00:00
   2299992455 | node-two    | 0/DDAA908 | 0/DDAA908  | 00:00:00   |                0 | 0 bytes         |      13763 | 00:00:00
(2 rows)
```

And it's already replicated. 

Run:

```sql
select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
```

to get some values from the generated data:

```
bdrdb=# select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
 count  |    sum
--------+-----------
 100000 | 498884606
(1 row)
```

#### On node-two

Run:

```sql
select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
```

to get node-two's values for the generated data:

```
bdrdb=# select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
 count  |    sum
--------+-----------
 100000 | 498884606
(1 row)
```

And the values will be identical.

You can repeat the process with node-three, or generate new data on any node and see it replicate to the other nodes.
