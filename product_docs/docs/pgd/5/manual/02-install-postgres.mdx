## Installing Postgres

You will need to install Postgres on all the hosts.

You will need to have an EDB account and use the [EDB Repos 2.0](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos) page.
Select your platform and Postgres edition. 
You will be presented with 2 steps of instructions, the first covering how to install the required package repository and the second covering how to load the packages from that repository.

Run both steps.

## Worked example

In our example, we will be installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server 16 on Rocky Linux 9 (a RHEL compatible Linux).

### EDB account

You'll need an EDB account to install both Postgres and PGD.

You should have an EDB account. Use this account to sign in to the [EDB Repos 2.0](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos) page where you can select your platform and then scroll down the list to select the Postgres version you wish to install:

* EDB Postgres Advanced Server
* EDB Postgres Extended
* PostgreSQL

Upon selecting the version of the Postgres server you want, two steps will be displayed.


### 1: Configuring repositories

For step 1, you can choose to use the automated script or step through the manual install instructions that are displayed. Your EDB repository token will be automatically inserted into these scripts; it will be shown in the examples as `XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`.

On each provisioned host, either run the automatic repository installation script which will look like this: 

```
curl -1sLf 'https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/enterprise/setup.rpm.sh' | sudo -E bash
```

Or use the manual installation steps which look like this:

```
dnf install yum-utils 
rpm --import 'https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/enterprise/gpg.E71EB0829F1EF813.key'
curl -1sLf 'https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/enterprise/config.rpm.txt?distro=el&codename=9' > /tmp/enterprise.repo
dnf config-manager --add-repo '/tmp/enterprise.repo'
dnf -q makecache -y --disablerepo='*' --enablerepo='enterprisedb-enterprise'
```

### 2: Install Postgres

For step 2, we just run the command to install the packages.

```
sudo dnf -y install edb-as16-server
```
